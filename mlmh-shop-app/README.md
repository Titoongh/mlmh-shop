This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Next steps

- [ ] Test all endpoints
- [ ] Test prisma studio to see if my father could use it as it is otherwise create ugly forms to do it
- [ ] fill database with 2 artists and 2 tabs per artist
- [ ] Implement payment with stripe and/or paypal and test it
- [ ] continue with implementing frontend features especially the search, product page, and payment page
- [ ] Later: We will need to create custom links for downloading tabs: I think that I should create forms so that my dad can add its previous tabs and artists. When adding a dropbox link, my server should download the file directly and store it locally so that it can generate a one time download link.
